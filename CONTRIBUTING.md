#Contributing to this project

Thanks for thinking about contributing to this project!

## The legal stuff

When you submit a pull request to this repository for the first time, you'll be prompted to sign a Developer Certificate of Origin ("DCO"). You should read the DCO carefully because it's legally binding. At a high level, it tells us that you have the right to submit the work you're contributing in your pull requests and says that you consent to us treating the contriubtion in a way consistent with the project or the license associated with this project. You can read the license associated with this project in `LICENSE.md`. 

You can submit contributions anonymously or under a pseudonym if you'd like, but we need to be able to reach you at the email address associated with your github account (which is what you sign the DCO). 

It probably goes without saying, but contributions you make to this public Deparment of Defense ("DoD") repository are completely voluntary. When you submit a pull request, you're offering your contribution to DoD without expectation of payment and you expressly waive any future pay claims against the U.S. Federal government related to your contribution. 

One last thing, if you're a U.S. Federal government employee and use a *.mil or *.gov email address, we interpret your signed DCO to mean that the contribution was created in whole or in part by you as part of your job with the U.S. Federal government and that your contribution is not subject to copyright protections.

Glad we've squared that away!
